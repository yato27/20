										<h4><b><i>Our Kitchenware Store Story</i></b></h4><br>

										The brand was started over 20 years ago and was the first company to sell cookware sets by direct mail in the UK. Since then it has grown into a multi-channel specialist cookware company with over 50 nationwide stores. Still owned and managed by one of the original founding family members, Kitchenware Store still retains its inherently important small company values and ethos.<br><br><br>

										<h4><b><i>Our Mission</i></b></h4><br>
										To supply cookware and kitchenware of an outstanding level of quality and design saving you up to 50% off other leading brands.<br><br><br>

										<h4><b><i>"We aim to deliver all our Kitchenware Store products to you at unbelievable value for money."</i></b></h4><br>

										What started as a range of essential cookware has grown into extensive ranges of cookware, knives, non-stick bakeware and roasting, kitchen and table accessories.

										Kitchenware Store specialize in timeless styles with clean contemporary looks that can happily slot into any kitchen or dining room. What's more nearly everything is own brand and exclusive to Kitchenware Store.<br><br><br>

										<h4><b><i>Our Pricing Policy</i></b></h4><br>

										Our aim is to save you, the customer, up to 50% compared to other leading brands and we do this by cutting out the middleman. This means that by not using import agents and UK distributors our costs are less as we bring our products direct from the manufacturers. These savings we pass directly onto you.

										We refer to 'typical price' as the price of other similar products from other leading brands. This is based on the closest equivalent product in design and functionality, but which may differ in other respects, such as finishes and materials.

										We endeavour to check all our competitors prices every three months, however within that time period other leading brands prices may be subject to fluctuation.</p>
