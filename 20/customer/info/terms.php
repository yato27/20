								<li>You will be guided through the process of placing an order by a series of simple instructions on the Website.</li> 
								<li>We will send to you an order acknowledgement email detailing the products you have ordered within 1-2 hours of the order being placed.</li>

								Non-acceptance of an order may arise for a number of reasons. By way of example, this could be a result of one of the following:<br>

								<li>Our inability to obtain authorisation for your payment.</li>
								<li>The identification of a pricing or product description error.</li>
								<li>You are not meeting the eligibility to order criteria set out in these Conditions.</li>

								<br>GL2 2BY</p>

								<br>

								<h4>Contract Cancellation</h4>
								<p>You will have 30* days after the day you (or someone you nominate) receives the Products (unless the Products are split into several deliveries over different days, in which case you have until 30* days after the day you (or someone you nominate) receives the last delivery) to cancel your contract with us without giving any reason.

								<br><br>(* this gives you more time than the 14 days you would normally be given under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013)

								<li>Goods made to your specification or are clearly personalised.</li>

We may make a deduction from the reimbursement for loss in value of any Products supplied, if the loss is the result of unnecessary handling by you. We will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and no later than: (i) 14 days after the day we receive back from you any Products supplied; or (ii) (if earlier) 14 days after the day on which you provide evidence that you have returned the Products. We will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise, in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement.
								<br><br>You shall send back any Products without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which you communicate your cancellation of your contract to us. The deadline is met if you send back the Products before the period of 14 days has expired. You will have to bear the cost of returning the Products in circumstances where you cancel your contract.
								<br><br>You are only liable for any diminished value of the Products resulting from the handling other than what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the Products.</p>
